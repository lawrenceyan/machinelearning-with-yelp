# machinelearning-with-yelp

Using a Voronoi diagram superimposed onto a specified map location (Ex. Downtown Berkeley), creates a simple visualization of predicted restaurant ratings in any area based on a compiled dataset of preexisting Yelp reviews nearby.

Visualization created utilizing a combination of simple least-squares linear regression and k-means algorithm.

Default sample data has been queried from restaurants near and around the UC Berkeley campus where I live. Feel free to query for your own specific location using the Fusion API.

The default user profile that will be used is based around my personal tastes and reviews. Feel free to create your own user profile and use that instead. Make sure to follow the format as set by the Users Data Abstraction within abstractions.py, and place it in the Users directory.

     Ex. File called Donald.dat

          make_user(

               'Donald Trump', # name

                    [ # reviews

                         make_review('Mar-a-lago', 5.0),
                         
                         etcâ€¦

                    ]

KEY: (Yellow is expected 5 star rating -> Blue is expected 1 star rating) (Restaurants are represented by dots with specific colors corresponding to their individual locations)

Run recommend.py to use this tool, --help for specific documentation on optional arguments that can be made to manipulate visualization.

     optional arguments:

     -h, --help show this help message and exit

     -u USER, --user USER user file, i.e. {test_user,one_cluster,likes_everything}

     -k K, --k K for k-means

     -q QUERY, --query QUERY

          search for restaurants by category e.g. {Beer, Wine & Spirits,Sports Bars,Convenience Stores}

     -p, --predict predict ratings for all restaurants

     -r, --restaurants outputs a list of restaurant names

A possible command you might make:

     Ex. python recommend.py -u likes_expensive -k 2 -p -q Sandwiches

This would result in a visualization of predicted ratings targeted towards sandwich restaurants specifically based on a user profile of someone who likes expensive restaurants.
