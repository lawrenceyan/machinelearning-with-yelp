# machinelearning-with-yelp

Using a Voronoi diagram superimposed onto a specified map location (Ex. Downtown Berkeley), creates a simple visualization of predicted restaurant ratings in any area based on a compiled dataset of preexisting Yelp reviews nearby.


KEY: (Yellow is expected 5 star rating -> Blue is expected 1 star rating)
     (Restaraunts are represented by dots with specific colors corresponding to their individual locations)

Default sample data from restaurants near and around the UC Berkeley campus. Feel free to input your locations with data captured using the Yelp Fusion API. 

Run recommend.py to use this tool; --help for specific documentation on what queries can be made to manipulate visualization.
