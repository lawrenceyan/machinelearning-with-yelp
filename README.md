# machinelearning-with-yelp

Using a Voronoi diagram superimposed onto map, creates a simple visualization of predicted restaurant ratings in any area based on a compiled dataset of preexisting Yelp reviews nearby.

KEY: 
(Yellow is expected 5 star rating -> Blue is expected 1 star rating)
  (Restaraunts are represented by dots with specific colors corresponding to their individual locations)

Run recommend.py to use this tool
--help for specific documentation on what queries can be made to manipulate visualization
